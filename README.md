# Battle_Tank
The BattleTank game from Ben Tristem's UnrealCourse which I'm following.

BattleTank is a game made in Unreal Engine 4. The player controls a tank on a small landscape. The second tank is controlled by a second local player or AI.

## Concept:
* Tank battle is an open-world head-to-head tank combat game.
* The terrain will be used for tactical advantage.
* The focus will be on flow and feel.

## Rules:
* You can move anywhere in the terrain, which is surrounded by mountains
* Both players start with finite health and ammo
* ​Each direct hit takes away health
* The last player standing wins.

## Requirements:
* SFX: Gun firing, explosion, barrel moving, turret moving, engine sound.
* Static mesh: Simple tank comprising tracks, body, turret and barrel.
* Textures: Later-on we’ll want to add for visual flare.
* Music:​ Background music to create tension.
